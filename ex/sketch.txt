Man: Is this the right room for an argument?
Woman: I've told you once
Man: No you haven't
Woman: Yes you have
Man: When?
Woman: Just now.
Man: No you didn't
Woman: Yes I did
Man: You didn't
Woman: I am telling you, I did!
Man: You did not
Woman: Oh I am sorry, is this a five minute argument, or the full half hour?
Man: Ah! (taking out his wallet and paying) Just the five minutes
Woman: Just the five minutes. Thank you
Woman: Anyway, I did
Man: You most certainly did not!
Woman: Now let's get one thing quite clear: I most certainly told you
Man: Oh, no you didn't
Woman: Oh, yes I did
